Project description:  
When a guitarist is learning a song, it is often necessary to gain a deeper  
understanding of the song and various intricacies involved with replicating the guitar part.   
An existing technology that helps with this is audio stem-splitting which allows for isolation of different  
instruments without access to the multi-tracks of the song. While leading applications offering stem-splitting  
functionality can be valuable for practice and learning, most don't offer any kind of qualitative data on each  
song to build on the insight gained from instrument isolation, potentially leading to users missing key inferrences.  
Additionally, many popular applications in this field aren’t developed specifically for guitarists and therefore can   
be a somewhat compromised experience in attempting to cater to all musicians.  
  
SongAssist is an all-in-one practice web application for guitarists to learn songs in a single focused environment with minimal interruptions to workflow, this application directly addresses previous limi. The application allows users to upload an audio file of any format with which the guitar will be isolated from all other instruments and vocals, SongAssist’s user friendly interface makes it easy to quickly adjust the relative volumes of the backing track and guitar.

Once the user’s file has been stem-separated, SongAssist can also provide AI-powered advice on how to play the song and is prompt-engineered to answer any of the user’s questions throughout the learning process. Chord sheets for learning the user’s song can also be AI-generated and saved within the corresponding project, if the user wishes to change the arrangement of the song or any inaccuracies are spotted in generated chords then manual changes can be made and accessed in the future.

SongAssist provides the functionality for users to create loops of the section they are currently learning, these sections can then be saved and labelled. The playback speed of the loaded song can be adjusted to fit the user’s preference with straightforward UI elements for doing so. If the user wishes to download their separated stems to their local machine then this is also possible.
