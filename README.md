Project title: SongAssist: A Comprehensive Song Practice App for Musicians

Project description:  
When a guitarist is learning a song, it is often necessary to gain a deeper  
understanding of the song and various intricacies involved with replicating the guitar part.   
An existing technology that helps with this is audio stem-splitting which allows for isolation of different  
instruments without access to the multi-tracks of the song. While leading applications offering stem-splitting  
functionality can be valuable for practice and learning, most don't offer any kind of qualitative data on each  
song to build on the insight gained from instrument isolation, potentially leading to users missing key inferrences.  
Additionally, many popular applications in this field aren’t developed specifically for guitarists and therefore can   
be a somewhat compromised experience in attempting to cater to all musicians.  
  
SongAssist is a web application that aims to solve this problem by providing extensive stem-separation features that allow for  
stem-splitting of any MP3 file uploaded by the user and AI-assisted tips on emulating the guitar playing in the song along with  
generation of musical notation where possible. The application aims to be accessible to any guitarist, even with limited technical  
knowledge SongAssist should be straightforward to use without any confusion.  
  
In order to achieve all of this functionality, the project will involve web app development, user-interface design,
AI-powered stem-splitting, audio file manipulation and local data storage.

List of requirements (objectives):   
Essential:  
•	Provide AI-assisted stem-splitting instrument isolation functionality.  
•	Ensure the web application can play MP3 files from the user's device.  
•	Implement a feature to add and delete bookmarks at specific timestamps within a song.  
•	Incorporate a feature to adjust the playback speed of the MP3 file without distorting the pitch.  

Desirable:  
•	Create on-screen buttons to instantly rewind or fast-forward to the nearest bookmark.  
•	Enable users to create, edit, and manage multiple playlists of songs they are learning.  
•	Include an interactive stem mixer.  
•   Provide an AI assistant that gives insight on the song where possible.

Optional:  
•	Develop a feature to allow users to pitch shift their MP3 files.  
•	Allow users to name or label their bookmarks for easier identification.  
•	Implement a waveform display of the audio track to allow for more precise bookmark placement.  
•	Develop a customizable user-interface.
