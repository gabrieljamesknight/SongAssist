Project title: SongAssist: A Comprehensive Song Practice App for Musicians

Project description:
When a musician is learning a song, it is often necessary to manipulate audio of the track to gain a deeper 
understanding of its various intricacies. An existing technology that helps with this is audio stem-splitting 
which allows for isolation of each instrument without access to the multi-tracks of the song. While leading applications
offering stem-splitting functionality can be valuable for practicing and learning, they are mostly 
DAWs (Digital Audio Workstation) and aren’t geared specifically towards practice and simplicity. SongAssist is a 
web application that aims to solve this problem by providing extensive stem-separation features that allow for
stem-splitting of any MP3 file uploaded by the user and manipulation of these stems through speed adjustment and
mixing of each split-stem; the application aims to be accessible to any musician with limited technical knowledge
being sufficient.

In order to achieve all of this functionality, the project will involve web app development, user-interface design,
AI-powered stem-splitting, audio file manipulation and local data storage.

List of requirements (objectives):
Essential:
•	Provide AI-assisted stem-splitting instrument isolation functionality.
•	Ensure the web application can play MP3 files from the user's device.
•	Implement a feature to add and delete bookmarks at specific timestamps within a song.
•	Incorporate a feature to adjust the playback speed of the MP3 file without distorting the pitch.

Desirable:
•	Create on-screen buttons to instantly rewind or fast-forward to the nearest bookmark.
•	Enable users to create, edit, and manage multiple playlists of songs they are learning.
•	Include an interactive stem mixer.

Optional:
•	Develop a feature to allow users to pitch shift their MP3 files.
•	Allow users to name or label their bookmarks for easier identification.
•	Implement a waveform display of the audio track to allow for more precise bookmark placement.
•	Develop a customizable user-interface.
